=============================== Instructions ===============================
Project 5 jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) are included which contains all questions. Almost all questions are answered in R. 
All notebooks with "preprocessing" in its name are written in Python, and are for the most part used to generate text files to be used in R.

This project needs external files to run, which we have not included. If you wish to run it, please include the following files:

From the IMDb dataset found at https://ucla.app.box.com/s/z45q3g5zrpay8b8gtbql6ojaecb7kj2u, download:
- actor_movies.txt
- actress_movies.txt
- movie_rating.txt
- movie_genre.txt

Before running any files, please place these in a folder labeled "project4_data" and place the folder in the current directory.

Because text files are being generated, it's important to run the Jupyter notebooks in order so as not to get an error. The files should be run in the following order:
- q_1_2_preprocessing.ipynb
- q_2.ipynb
- q_3.ipynb
- q_4_5.ipynb
- q_6_preprocessing.ipynb
- q_6.ipynb
- q_7_proprocessing.ipynb
- q_7.ipynb
- q_8_preprocessing.ipynb
- q_8.ipynb
- q_8_3.ipynb
- q_9.ipynb
- q_10.ipynb
- q_11.ipynb
- q_12_preprocessing.ipynb
- q_12.ipynb
- q_13.ipynb

Please also make sure that the object files "q_4_5_cast_page_rank.rda" and "q_7_cluster_fast_greedy.rda" are in the current directory.
